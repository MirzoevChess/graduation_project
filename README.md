🌍 Deployment

The Plantify project is fully deployed on Render:

Backend: hosted on Render and provides all API endpoints.

The frontend communicates with the backend through REST API requests, so the entire application works online.

Users can explore products, apply filters, add favorites, and interact with the store in real time.
